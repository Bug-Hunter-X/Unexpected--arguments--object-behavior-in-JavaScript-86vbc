This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in JavaScript related to the `arguments` object.  The `arguments` object, while appearing array-like, is not a true array and lacks standard array methods.  Attempting to use array methods on it (like `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, etc.) will result in errors or unexpected results. The solution shows how to convert `arguments` to a real array using techniques like `Array.from()` or the spread syntax.
